function [stats, hist2d] = phi_statistics(d, D, phi, max_phi)
% PHI_STATISTICS computes statistical measures on angular deviation
%
% stats = PHI_STATISTICS(d, D, phi)
% stats = PHI_STATISTICS(d, D, phi, max_phi)
% [stats, hist2d] = PHI_STATISTICS(d, D, phi)
% [stats, hist2d] = PHI_STATISTICS(d, D, phi, max_phi)
%
% Input:
% - d: vector of distances for which the statistics shall be computed
% - D: 3D SDF volume
% - phi: 3D volume of deviation angles (in degrees)
% - max_phi (optional): cut-off value for phi in histogram (default: 2Â°)
%
% Output:
% - stats: array of size length(d) x 4, with the four columns
%    1: mean of all phi with abs(D)<d
%    2: median of all phi with abs(D)<d
%    3: root mean square of all phi with abs(D)<d
%    4: 95th percentile of all phi with abs(D)<d
% - hist (optional):  histogram of all phi with abs(D)<d, per entry in d
